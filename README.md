# Capstone Project: Exploratory Data Analysis on The Global Terrorism Database (GTD)
## Project Type - EDA/Regression/Classification/Unsupervised
## Project Summary -
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) documents more than 180000 international and domestic terrorist attacks that occurred worldwide since 1970.This project is on Global Terrorism Data menas in this project there are some data about terrorist incident happen in the world . And which country or region are affected from terrorism the most . In this data there are 135 thing given.In which year specified the attack of the yaer ,date of attack , country , region , city , state , logitude , latitude , summary of the attack in which how many people died and how many injurd , type of attack , group that take the responsibility of the attack , wepon used in attack , committee form after the attack and who is responsible for the attack and so on many useful data given in this data set. This dataset is given from date 1970 to 2017 means in this data every attack happend between 1970 to 2017 is given which is very useful for security of the country. From given data we can find out which regions which country affectd the most and what steps shoud be taken so that we can prevent the ferthure that should not happen in future. We can see that the type of attack happening on the country and what effect it cause on the country and how many lives would lost due to attacks . We can see that the frequency of attack happening every year and it is reducing or increasing and which region it is reducing and which region it is increasing and the country who is controling the attack or did not do any thing . Which type of wepon used in the attack and what that wepon harms the people menas that how much it is lethal for the humanity . In this data there are summary of attack which is written on summary section in which there are summary of whole incident means who is the attacker and who is the defender and what casulities cause by the attacker and what are the damages done by the attacker how many attacker are there and who is captured alive and who is died in the line of fire. In the data there are mentioned the type of attack means what is the motive of the attack either it is assissination or kidnaping or robbery or bombing or assult or mass shooting and so on . And in this data there are also mention that the type of attack which means attack happen on private property or gorvment official or media house or school and so on. In data set there are mention a column that told about the people died in the attack and the name of or designation of the person who is died in the attack and the nationality of that person who is died in the attack . In this data set there are also mention the gang name who done the attack and motive behind the attack which was done by the gang member or the orgniser of the attack. This project aims to have a profound impact on global counterterrorism efforts by leveraging the GTD as a critical resource. By combining rigorous data analysis, policy recommendations, and academic contributions, the project seeks to empower governments and organizations to address terrorism with a deeper understanding of its underlying dynamics and develop strategies that enhance security, promote peace, and protect societies worldwide.

## Expected Outcomes of the project:

->Comprehensive Pandas DataFrames containing structured GTD data.

->Enhanced data exploration capabilities, enabling deeper insights into terrorism trends.

->Informative data visualizations and statistical analysis results.

->Improved understanding of the factors contributing to terrorism.

->Insights that can inform counterterrorism strategies and policies.

## Impact:

This project seeks to empower data scientists, researchers, and analysts by providing them with a powerful toolset for exploring and analyzing the GTD data efficiently. By leveraging Pandas DataFrames, the project aims to facilitate evidence-based decision-making, advance our understanding of global terrorism dynamics, and ultimately contribute to the development of more effective counterterrorism strategies and policies.   


## Problem Statement
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is a valuable resource for understanding global terrorism trends and patterns. However, the use of the GTD for advanced data analysis with Pandas DataFrames presents several significant challenges and limitations, which need to be addressed to unlock its full potential for data-driven insights and decision-making. This problem statement can be broken down into specific analysis tasks and questions:

1. Data Preparation and Cleaning: Acquire and load the GTD dataset into a pandas DataFrame. Filter the data to include records . Handle missing values, correct data types, and perform data cleaning as necessary.

2.Pattern Analysis: Analyze trends in terrorism incidents in the world over the specified decade. Explore patterns related to the types of attacks (e.g., bombings, shootings), target types (e.g., civilians, military), and attack methods (e.g., explosives, firearms).

3.Factors Identification: Perform statistical analysis and visualizations to understand correlations and associations between these factors and terrorism incidents.

4.Hotspot Identification: Determine regions or cities that are most affected by terrorism. Create heatmaps or geographical visualizations to pinpoint high-activity areas.

Define Your Business Objective?
"To analyze global terrorism trends over the past decade and identify regions with increasing terrorist activities to assist international security agencies in deploying resources more effectively."

### With this business objective in mind, you can break it down into specific analysis tasks and questions:

1. Data Preparation and Cleaning:

Load the GTD dataset into a pandas DataFrame. Filter the data to include only records from 1970 to 2017. Handle missing values, correct data types, and perform necessary data cleaning steps.

2. Trend Analysis:

Calculate the annual number of terrorist incidents worldwide over the specified period. Visualize the trends in terrorism incidents using line charts or time series analysis.

3. Region Identification:

Identify regions or countries with the highest and lowest increases in terrorist activities over the decade. Group data by regions and calculate statistics like the total number of incidents, fatalities, or changes in attack methods.

4.Hotspot Mapping:

Create geographical heatmaps or choropleth maps to visualize regions with increasing terrorism activities. Utilize latitude and longitude information to pinpoint specific locations of incidents.

# Conclusion
A comprehensive analysis of global terrorism data serves as a powerful tool for gaining deeper insights into the complex and evolving nature of terrorism worldwide. In this EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project, we have delved into various facets of terrorism data to uncover trends, patterns, and important takeaways that are crucial for understanding this critical global issue.

We have examined how the frequency and severity of terrorist incidents have evolved over time. This provides important context for understanding the dynamics of terrorism and its response by governments and international organizations.

By mapping terrorism incidents, we have identified hotspots and regions where terrorism is particularly prevalent. This can aid in targeted risk assessment and mitigation efforts for businesses and governments operating in these areas.

Analyzing the types of attacks (e.g., bombings, kidnappings, shootings) has shed light on the tactics employed by terrorist groups. Understanding these tactics can inform security measures and preparedness strategies.

We have explored the types of targets chosen by terrorists, which can range from civilian populations to government installations. This information is crucial for assessing potential vulnerabilities and developing protective measures.

In conclusion, this EDA project has provided valuable insights into the global terrorism landscape. It underscores the importance of data-driven analysis and informed decision-making when dealing with the multifaceted challenges posed by terrorism. By continuing to explore and analyze terrorism data, we can work towards a better understanding of the factors driving this phenomenon and develop more effective strategies for preventing and mitigating its impact. This knowledge is not only relevant for policymakers and security experts but also for businesses, organizations, and individuals seeking to navigate an increasingly complex global landscape.
